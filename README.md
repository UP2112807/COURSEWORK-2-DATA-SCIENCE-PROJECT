This project looks at the Palmer Penguins Dataset Extended datset which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samybaladram/palmers-penguin-dataset-extended?select=palmerpenguins_extended.csv. <br>
This dataset contains the information about 3 penguin species. Inclusing information about the penguins species,	island,	health info and	year of data collection. <br>
I chose this dataset as it contained over 3000 entries compared to the original Palmer Penguins Dataset because this would be useful when training/testing a neural network and to a lesser extent when making a descion tree model. <br>
Additionaly this dataset contained 11 collumns of info on each penguin which meant that even if multiple features arent relevent to the target of the model being made I would still have features to use. <br>

This project goes over 3 questions looking at the species of penguins <br>
- Q1: traditional - non neural network approach
- Q2: Neural Network approach
- Q3: How does pre-training (and epochs and batches) affect the performance of a neural network? 

Motivation for Q3 is after initially craeting a neural network in Q2 I found that the accuracy of predictions plateaued after it went pasts a certain number of epochs and I wanted to find what impact changing this would have on my neural network <br>
Run each file run top to bottom making sure that you have the functions.py file one directory above the question .ipynb files. <br>
Dependencies are contained with the dependencies.txt file <br>
